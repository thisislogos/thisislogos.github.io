class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><p>When you combine talent, spontaneity, energy, and a little dose of randomness—you get Samantha Tan.</p><p>She is the girl who pours her heart and soul into the songs she sings with her guitar <em>(which can just melt… your heart away</em>) and then pull off a super spontaneous action or joke right after which makes you go <em>“What was that?!”.</em> But beyond all that craziness, there are many layers and depths to her hence, it was clear that Sam had to be our very first feature here in Lógos Muse Stories.</p><p>Sam is a digital marketer in WOBB, makes music covers and creates beautiful calligraphy art. As a college student, Sam was also part of the Student Council association and pioneered the Floorball club in Monash University. Not to mention that Sam also serves faithfully in her church’s worship team.<br/>‍</p><h2>What is the latest movie or TV series that you have watched?</h2><p><em>I feel like people are going to start judging me based off this first question haha. I haven’t really watched many movies or series since I started working but lately, I’ve been watching a Korean reality show based off BTS (a Kpop boy group) and their vacations, called Bon Voyage.</em></p><figure style="max-width:1080pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets-global.website-files.com/5e9043dcacbf45bdf41f9017/5f0d3d2fe2c2be321af85b5f_muse-003-06.JPG" alt=""/></div></figure><h2>You sing, you play the piano and guitar, and you also do calligraphy art. As someone who is gifted with multiple talents, do you think that creative talent is something that is nurtured or it’s a given thing (nature)?</h2><p><em>TL;DR, I think that it’s really both nature and nurture. </em></p><p><em>From my music aspect, I’ve always loved it since I was young and I consider myself incredibly blessed by God for every talent that I have. </em><strong><em>But just because you have a talent doesn’t mean that it is at a 100% naturally. It starts from probably a 10% and you’ve got to work on it to watch it grow and reach its full potential.</em></strong><em> Honestly, I’m not even half of what I aspire to be but it’s a humbling experience in knowing that albeit you have a talent, you can always be better and that motivates me to work harder in improving my skills. </em></p><p><em>I think it also came with self-interest—like the kind where you actually go for piano class because you enjoy it and not ‘cause your parents make you go, y’know haha. Back when I was still learning piano, I did it just because my parents made me learn since I was young and also ‘cause I’m a bit kiasu lah (must finish till Grade 8 hahah). But the funny thing is only after my classes, did I realize the value in what I was learning. Music peeps, you’ll understand the next part—there’s this thing called cadences as a part of aural and it’s basically chord progressions that you’ve got to hear the instructor play and you’ll have to recite what the progression was afterward. Trust me, I could only get like 1 out out 5 times right hahah (Sorry for stressing you, aunty Boon Leng). But it was only after when I forced myself to learn to play Christian songs without looking at the chords that I realized, I could’ve saved myself the trouble if I actually understood and cherished the value of what I was learning back in piano class. </em></p><p><em> As for my calligraphy, it’s a funny story actually. My dad is an artist and people used to think that I would be great at drawing too but heh, I was not. Dad used to try and teach me simple drawings too but I never really got the hang of it. But when I was about 18 or so, I fell in love with modern calligraphy and I guess it was around then only that my “artistic” side showed. From there it was just a lot of practice and to be honest, I’m still learning something new every day.</em></p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets-global.website-files.com/5e9043dcacbf45bdf41f9017/5f0ef11532d9b99adf25eee2_muse-003-04.JPG" alt=""/></div></figure><h2>While you have recently created an Instagram channel just for your music covers, could you share with us why you do what you do?</h2><p><em>Ain’t gonna lie, my dream ever since I discovered I had a gifting was to become a singer, sell out stadiums kind of thing haha (a far-fetched dream but hey, a girl can dream). But I didn’t want to be just any pop artist. I know that what I have is not because of my own doing but it is God who gave me these talents, so I wanted to use my voice to honour Him in return. </em></p><p><em>I actually started my YouTube account when I was 17 I think but I never really committed to making covers because honestly, it’s a lot of hard work and I didn’t really like think it through at that time? It was more of “I want to sing and make music so let’s just post something for the fun of it” kind of thing and I wasn’t active anymore after that—about less than 10 covers in the last 5 years. </em></p><p><em>But over this MCO period I had about a month or two of pre-quarter life crisis hahah and </em><strong><em>thought to myself “Do I really want to let my life and giftings go to waste and just live life as it comes?”</em></strong><em> Even in the Bible, in Matthew 25:14-30, it talks about the parable of the talents, to summarize, basically a master gives 3 servants an allocated amount of money each according to their ability. He then goes away and while he’s gone, the first 2 servants invest the money while the third one does nothing with it. When the master comes back, he is proud of the first 2 that did something with their money but he called the third one wicked and lazy as he gave excuses as to why he didn’t do anything with it. And I don’t want to be like the third servant. I want to be able to steward my gifting rightly to bless and encourage others. </em></p><p><em>So, I do what I do because I know that I’ve been blessed with my musical ability not to keep for myself, but to bless others around me. </em><strong><em>If what I do can help save someone from going into depression, or committing suicide, or even encourage those with talents to step out and do something with it, and really to just allow God to work in and through my life, then that’s all I need to keep going.<br/>‍</em></strong></p><h2>What is the 1 thing about making music covers which many may not know about you?</h2><p><em>I think people may just think that all I do is sing covers but I write songs too. Just that.. they’re mostly Christian songs hahah. They’re still a work in progress and I don’t really want to release them with just me, a guitar and piano track. Like I want a fully produced album with a little bit of untz untz like those proper studio recording quality kind of album haha. One day lah ya.</em></p><figure style="max-width:2400pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets-global.website-files.com/5e9043dcacbf45bdf41f9017/5f0d2dae9feb13cd877b7cf2_muse-003-02.JPG" alt=""/></div></figure><h2>I think that as artists and creatives, there is often a heavy weight of expectation that we put on ourselves sometimes, which may sometime lead to this feeling of inadequacy or lack of confidence in the art that we create. Have you ever felt like what you create is inadequate? If so, how do you combat it?</h2><p><em>Oh boyyy, right up my alley hahaha. I constantly feel like the music or artwork I produce is inadequate honestly. Ask my cousin. She’s been there through my 5-hour recording sessions hahah. Also being somewhat of a perfectionist, the burden of “imperfection” is truly heavy.</em></p><p><em>But I guess sometimes you have to remind yourself that you are the only one who can be you. Whatever I deem as inadequate or mundane may not be the same to another person because I’m so used to hearing my own voice, seeing my own artwork or hearing myself play an instrument the same way. And hey, </em><strong><em>it’s my imperfections that make me unique</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p><em>But ultimately, I go back to the Word. </em><strong><em>I root myself in knowing that I am a child of God, loved by the Father who knew me before I was even formed.</em></strong><em> And knowing that all that I do is for Him and to please Him, I just do my best and believe that He’s proud of me.<br/>‍</em></p><h2>How do you recharge yourself after a long day?</h2><p><em>I like to watch BTS videos hahaha (don’t @ me okay those boys make me happy lol) or listening to Christian music and before I sleep, spend some time doing my devotion. If I had a really rough day, I enjoy just sitting on the balcony and worshipping. Try it sometime! There’s just something about sitting in the silence and staring at the night sky in awe and wonder.<br/>‍</em></p><h2>Who has been the biggest creative influence in your life?</h2><p><em>Hmm.. I think I would have to say my dad. As I mentioned earlier, my dad is an artist but he was also the one who taught me how to play guitar, sing duets like “Lucky” by Jason Mraz with me, teach me about nature, animals and bugs and how God made each of them beautiful and unique (even though I still think insects are nastee haha). He used to own an advertising company too, so growing up around him and his creativity really had a huge impact on me.</em></p><figure style="max-width:2400pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets-global.website-files.com/5e9043dcacbf45bdf41f9017/5f0d2dd442a9ed2bc3de2711_muse-003-01.JPG" alt=""/></div></figure><h2>What is the best advice someone has given to you?</h2><p><em>Hmm.. honestly, I don’t have a piece of advice that I would consider is the best advice but someone who always gives me the best advice would be my dad. I’ve been bugging him to write a book full of his experiences and advice lol. I think this isn’t advice exactly but it’s something that has stuck with me. I’m a relational, feeling, kinda person and I tend to follow my emotions more. So, I asked him one night (and this thought was something I struggled quite a bit with), dad how do you know that God loves you? Like yes, I know Jesus died for us etc. but sometimes it’s just I don’t “feel” it. Y’know? And he said this that I’ll never forget – the message lah, the words all I cannot remember already haha. I paraphrase okay. He said you know I love you right? In which I replied yes. </em><strong><em>Then he said, even if I’m not with you (Pops is in Penang and I’m in KL), or I don’t say it, you still know I love you right? And I said yes. Then similar to how God loves us, it’s just something you know.</em></strong><em> And ever since that day, whenever I felt far from God, I remember that conversation with my dad and everything feels much better </em>😊<em>.</em><br/>‍</p><h2>If you could tell 15-year-old Sam one thing right now, what would it be?</h2><p><em>Oh mann.. I think I’d say, singleness is not a punishment for not being in a relationship. </em><strong><em>Your season of singleness is a blessing and it’s to allow God to work in your life, train and equip you for His purposes while you are still you and unattached to someone else, and teach you to love Him before loving anyone else</em></strong><em>. One day you’re going to realize that being in a relationship is not your whole life and there is so much more to life than meeting someone, getting married, settling down, having kids and growing old. </em></p><p><em>If you’re reading this and wondering why I’m talking about this outta nowhere haha it’s because I never used to enjoy being single (I think it’s ‘cause of all those K-dramas lah honestly hahah. Unrealistic expectations of what a relationship is like *rolls eyes*). But as I mentioned, I am a very relational person, and relationships, plutonic or romantic are very important to me. So, I used to fall *hard* for people until I realized that hey, that’s not all there is to life and I’d say I can manage my feelings better now hahah.<br/>‍</em></p><h2>Last question, if the only mode of transportation available for you is between a donkey and giraffe—which would it be? And why?</h2><p><em>Wahh so random haha. I think I’d pick a giraffe so just in case I fall asleep on my journey, I can fall asleep on its neck HAHA. If I chose a donkey, I’ll straight chapalengtao. I might end up somewhere else but that one’s another story la. Also, have y’all seen those wild giraffes drink water, so cute. Almost be doing a sploot hehe.</em></p><figure style="max-width:3208pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../../assets-global.website-files.com/5e9043dcacbf45bdf41f9017/5f0ef148f916c0183dcd65fc_muse-003-03.JPG" alt=""/></div></figure><p>If you would like to see more of the content that Sam produces, check out her music Instagram handle <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sam.t_music/" target="_blank">@sam.t_music</a> and her calligraphy Instagram handle <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thesamproject.my/" target="_blank">@thesamproject.my</a></p></div><div class="references-rt-block w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer-navigation"><div class="footer-copyright">© 2024 Lógos</div><div class="footer-wrap"><div class="footer-items"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisislogos" target="_blank" class="footer-item">Instagram</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thisislogos" target="_blank" class="footer-item">Facebook</a><a href="mailto:info@thisislogos.com" class="footer-item">Email: info@thisislogos.com</a></div></div></div></div><script src="../../d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8%EF%B9%96site=5e9043dcacbf455d831f8fdb.js" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="../../assets-global.website-files.com/5e9043dcacbf455d831f8fdb/js/webflow.53cc4fb82.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
